## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

### Priority Areas

1. **Vector Store Implementations**
   - Implement new vector store adapters
   - See `src/rag_toolkit/core/vectorstore.py` for the protocol

2. **LLM Provider Integrations**
   - Add support for new LLM providers
   - See `src/rag_toolkit/core/llm.py` for the protocol

3. **Embedding Models**
   - Integrate new embedding models
   - See `src/rag_toolkit/core/embedding.py` for the protocol

4. **Examples and Tutorials**
   - Write tutorials for specific use cases
   - Share your RAG applications
   - Add to `examples/` directory

5. **Documentation**
   - Improve existing docs
   - Add missing sections
   - Translate to other languages
