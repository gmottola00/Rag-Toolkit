## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-22

### 🎉 Initial Release

This is the first official release of `rag-toolkit`, a production-ready library for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with Protocol-based architecture.

### Added

#### Core Components
- **Protocol-based Architecture**: Clean interface definitions using Python Protocols (PEP 544)
  - `EmbeddingClient`: Protocol for embedding providers
  - `LLMClient`: Protocol for language model providers
  - `VectorStoreClient`: Protocol for vector database operations
  - `ChunkLike` & `TokenChunkLike`: Protocols for document chunks

#### Chunking System
- **DynamicChunker**: Structure-aware chunking based on document heading hierarchy
  - Splits documents at level-1 headings
  - Preserves nested structure (subsections, paragraphs, lists, tables)
  - Configurable heading levels and table inclusion
  - Preamble handling for content before first heading

- **TokenChunker**: Token-based chunking with overlap
  - Configurable token limits (max, min, overlap)
  - Pluggable tokenizer support
  - Metadata extraction (tender codes, lot IDs, document types)
  - Two-stage pipeline compatibility (DynamicChunker → TokenChunker)

- **Concrete Implementations**: Dataclass implementations of chunking protocols
  - `Chunk`: Standard document chunk
  - `TokenChunk`: Token-optimized chunk with metadata

#### RAG Pipeline
- **RagPipeline**: End-to-end RAG workflow
  - Query rewriting for better retrieval
  - Vector-based search integration
  - LLM-based reranking
  - Context assembly
  - Answer generation with citations

- **Models**: Structured data models
  - `RagResponse`: Generated answer with source citations
  - `RetrievedChunk`: Retrieved document chunk with metadata and scores

#### Infrastructure
- **Multi-provider Support** (via lazy loading):
  - Ollama (embeddings and LLM)
  - OpenAI (embeddings and LLM)
  - Extensible for custom providers

- **Vector Store Abstraction**:
  - Milvus integration (built-in)
  - Protocol-based design for easy provider switching
  - Support for metadata filtering and hybrid search

#### Documentation
- **Comprehensive Sphinx Documentation**:
  - User guides for all core concepts
  - API reference with auto-generated docs
  - Practical examples and tutorials
  - Production deployment guides
  - Published at: https://gmottola00.github.io/rag-toolkit/

#### Development Tools
- **Test Suite**: 28 tests with 19% initial coverage
  - Core protocol compliance tests
  - Chunking strategy tests
  - RAG pipeline integration tests
  - Mock implementations for testing

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows
  - Automated testing across Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
  - Documentation builds and deployment
  - Code quality checks (ruff, black, isort, mypy)

### Supported Platforms
- **Python**: 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- **Operating Systems**: Linux, macOS, Windows (via WSL)
- **Vector Databases**: Milvus 2.3+
- **LLM Providers**: Ollama, OpenAI

### Dependencies
- Core: `pydantic>=2.0.0`, `pydantic-settings>=2.0.0`, `pymilvus>=2.3.0`
- Optional: `ollama`, `openai`, `pymupdf`, `python-docx`, `easyocr`, `langdetect`

### Known Limitations
- Test coverage at 19% (focused on core components)
- Milvus is currently the only built-in vector store (more coming soon)
- Document parsers (PDF, DOCX) included but minimally tested
- OCR support experimental

### Breaking Changes
None - initial release.

### Migration Guide
Not applicable - initial release.
